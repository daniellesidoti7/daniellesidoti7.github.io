     <h1>Why Maine?</h1>
<p> My summers as child were spent in our Maine summer home so i guess you could say
the whole Maine feeling feels like home in general and the atmosphere here is just
amazing. Another reason I choose Maine as to where i would spend my next four years is 
because i love the snow, and from when im hearing im in the right place to experience 
some pretty intense winters and im completely ready for them. When it snows in 
Massachusetts I get all my gear on and get myself in a comfortable spot and i just lay
there having the snow pile on top of my until im basically covered then i get up and move
to a new spot and start all over again. The snow falling from the sky is the prettiest
site you could ever watch, its just so calming and looks so beautiful.</p>
