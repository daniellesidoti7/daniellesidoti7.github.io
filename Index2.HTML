<h1>My Childhood</h1>
 <p>When I was a child I was honestly pretty wild, I
would take it upon myself to go wherever i pleased. I was a wild
child because at the time my parents were together so it was my
mother who would watch us and she really did not care what we did or
where we went, she would just want us home for curfew. After my
mother left the picture my life got interesting i actually had to
listen to my father and because at the time he wouldn't come home at
normal times because he would work so much so having to listen to
someone new made things a bit of an challenge but it gave me the
chance to becoming to my father. Becoming closing to him made me see
just how successful he was and why he wanted me to take over the
business instead of one of my sisters because I could truly
understand the concept of money and not just blow it all.</p>

	<p> During my childhood and teenage years I played two sports,
and they played a big role in my life. From either teaching me basic
lessons or opening up my eyes to see that everything can not allows
be fair in life. From 4 years old to 14 years old I played soccer and
once I got into highschool i stopped due to the fact that if you
weren't a like or known family you didn't make the team. That's when
I really started focusing on hockey and playing year around and
trying to get so good i might be able to get a scholarship or walk on
a team, but those dreams ended my summer going into my senior year
because i got my last major concussion. I wouldn't change anyhting in
my hockey career due to the fact that I learned that you have to earn
everything you get in life and being great at something and
practicing twenty-four seven will change everything, and that I got
injured in my prime season. </p>
