     <h1>My College Life</h1>
     <p>When i first came here to the University of Maine I wasn't nervous because I am
     used to being on my own and never seeing my family. Before i got here i worked
     thirty to forty hour weeks only working five of the seven days so if I wasn't home I
     would be either at work or with my boyfriends family due to the fact that they lived
     a few minutes from my work which made things a lot easier on me so i wouldn't have
     to drive over a half hour home at twelve or one in the morning. That's why being 
     here is more of proof to my dad that i can do this and be on my own after i finish 
     my schooling and that i am responsible enough to take our his business right out 
     of college so that he can finally get the retirement he deserves. This college 
     experience isn't a normal one as you can tell, I have something to prove and i can't
     let my father down.</p>
